# firefly-bitsy

Interpreter for running [Bitsy](https://bitsy.org/) games on [Firefly Zero](https://fireflyzero.com/).

Bitsy is a fun and simple game engine (and a web editor) for making simple story-driven games without writing any code. Bitsy games cannot benefit from the unique Firefly Zero features, like touchpad or multiplayer but it might be not a problem for some simple games.
